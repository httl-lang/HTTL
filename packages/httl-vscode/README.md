# HTTL for Visual Studio Code

[HTTL for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=HTTL.httl-vscode) brings powerful language support for the [HTTL programming language](https://httl.dev/), making it easy to write, execute, and test HTTP requests directly within VS Code.

## What is HTTL?

If you search for an "HTTP programming language," you'll likely be told that HTTP is just a protocol, not a language. But why isnâ€™t there a dedicated language for writing HTTP requests?

Think of how SQL allows structured data retrieval or how Terraform enables infrastructure as code. **HTTL does the same for HTTP requests and API testing.**

### Why HTTL?

- **Intuitive and easy to learn** â€“ Simple syntax designed for API workflows.
- **Intelligent OpenAPI support** â€“ Get smart IntelliSense suggestions.
- **Reusable requests** â€“ Save responses as variables for use in headers, bodies, and follow-up requests.
- **Built-in test scenarios** â€“ Write and run API tests natively, without mixing in JavaScript or Python.

ðŸš€ **Meet HTTL â€“ The first HTTP programming language!** ðŸŽ‰

With HTTL, you can replace UI-based tools like Postman or Insomnia with a powerful, code-first experience in VS Code.
