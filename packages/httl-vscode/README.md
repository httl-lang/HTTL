# HTTL for Visual Studio Code

[The VS Code HTTL extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=HTTL.httl-vscode)
provides rich language support for the
[HTTL programming language](https://httl.dev/).

## Welcome! 👋🏻<br/>

The short story behind this language is that I'm not a fan of having a UI to invoke my API.<br/>
I believe there's nothing better than code that can invoke other code. ;) <br/>
I wanted to create a simple language that is intuitive and easy to learn.  <br/>
A language that provides IntelliSense for OpenAPI. <br/>
A language that allows saving responses in variables to use them as headers or body content in subsequent requests. <br/>
<br/>
That's how HTTL came to be. <br/>
<br/>
HTTL aims to fill the gap left by UI-based API tools like Postman, Insomnia and others.


## Quick Start

1.  Install the [The VS Code HTTL extension].

2.  Create or Open *.httl file to activate the extension.

  <em>NOTE: Some features, such as IntelliSense and formatting, are not supported.</em>
