# HTTL for Visual Studio Code

[The VS Code HTTL extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=HTTL.httl-vscode)
provides rich language support for the
[HTTL programming language](https://httl.dev/).

## Why HTTL? Here’s the Short Story

Let’s face it: clicking through a UI to call an API isn’t exactly my idea of a good time. 🤷‍♂️ <br />
Why deal with all that when you can write code that talks to other code? Sounds way cooler, right? 😎

So, I set out to create something different — a language that’s:

- Simple and intuitive (no PhD in programming required). <br />
- Smart enough to offer IntelliSense for OpenAPI. <br />
- Flexible — you can save responses as variables and use them like building blocks for headers or body content in follow-up requests. <br />

And just like that, HTTL was born! 🎉 <br />
<br />
HTTL is here to shake things up and bridge the gap left by UI-based API tools like Postman, Insomnia, and the rest of the crew. <br />

1.  Install the [The VS Code HTTL extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=HTTL.httl-vscode).

2.  Create or Open *.httl file to activate the extension.

3.  Write a simple query e.g. `get https://httpbin.org/anything` and press F5 or CTRL|CMD+Enter

1. Alternatively, you can open the `Quick Run` panel if you don't want to create a file.
  <em>NOTE: Some features, such as IntelliSense and formatting, are not supported.</em>
