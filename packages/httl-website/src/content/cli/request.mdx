# Run a query from the command line

To run an HTTL query from the command line, use the following command:

```bash
 httl < method > < url > [headers] [body_format] [body]
```

Where: 
-  **`method`** - one of the HTTP methods from [the list](/docs/guide/request#request-line)

-  **`url`** - the URL to make the request, can be absolute or relative if you use along with a [default .httl file](/docs/guide/module#default-httl-file)

-  **`headers`** - headers in the format `key:value` separated by space, example: `Authorization:token`

-  **`body_format`** - body format, one of `--json` (default), `--formdata`, `--urlencoded`, `--raw`, `--bin`

-  **`body`** - body content, example: `{ name: "John" }`

## Examples

### Simple GET request

```bash
httl get https://httl.dev/api/users
```

### Simple GET request with a basic .httl file with content: `@base: https://httl.dev/api`
```bash
httl get users
```

### GET request with headers
```bash
httl get https://httl.dev/api/users Authorization:"Bearer token" Cache-Control:private
```

### POST request with a JSON body
```bash
httl post https://httpbin.org/anything '{ name: "John" }'
```

### PUT request with form data; JSON payload will be converted to form data
```bash
httl put https://httpbin.org/anything --formdata '{ name: "John" }'
```

### POST request with a URL-encoded body
```bash
httl post https://httpbin.org/anything --urlencoded '{ name: "John" }'
```

### POST request with a raw body
```bash
httl post https://httpbin.org/anything 'name=John&age=30'
```

### POST request with a binary file
```bash
httl post https://httpbin.org/anything --bin ./file.bin
```

### POST request with a payload from the input stream; HTTP will automatically detect the content type.
```bash
httl post https://httpbin.org/anything < ./payload.json
```
