# Run a HTTL file
 
To run a HTTL file, use the following command:

```bash
httl < file >
```

Where:
-  **`file`** - the path to the HTTL file

## Alternatively, you can use input redirection 

```bash
httl < file_path
```

## Or even heredoc syntax

```bash
httl <<EOF
@base: https://httl.dev/api
@auth-basic: admin admin
post /auth
EOF
```
