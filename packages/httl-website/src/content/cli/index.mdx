# HTTL CLI
 
Starting from version 0.1.7, HTTL provides a command-line interface (CLI) that allows you to run HTTL queries from the terminal. 
HTTL CLI is a great way to run HTTL queries in a CI/CD pipeline or to integrate them into your existing automation scripts.

#### HTTL CLI supports all the features of the HTTL language and also provides formatted and colorized terminal output
