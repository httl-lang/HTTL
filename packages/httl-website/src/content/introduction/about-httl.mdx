# What is HTTL?

**HTTL (“HyperText Transfer Language”)** is a lightweight programming language designed for developers who prefer using code to interact with APIs rather than relying on a UI (yes, finally!). 
<br />
It is a declarative language that lets you write API queries in a manner similar to SQL. Like SQL, HTTL allows you to write HTTP queries, store their results in variables, and then reference those variables in subsequent queries.
<br />
HTTL can also serve as an integration language between different systems. By allowing you to write queries for multiple APIs in a single file, it simplifies data exchange and orchestration across diverse services.
