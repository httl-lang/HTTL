# Feedback & Contributing
 
Yes, please! More feedback, more contributions, more ideas—bring it all!
I already have plenty of items on the roadmap, but I’m sure there are many things I haven’t thought of yet.

So if you have any feedback, ideas, or contributions, don’t hesitate to reach out. I’m always happy to hear from you!
