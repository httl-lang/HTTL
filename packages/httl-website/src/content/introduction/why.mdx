# Why Not?
 
Well, it actually a good question, waht the reason of having a new language for relatively simple thing, elsepical ywhen there are already plenty of good tool/languages.
The answer is in title ;) why not? As already mention there are buncj of good toll but each of them has their benefits and drawbacks.
These are the basic driwers behind the HTTL:
- **Simplicity**:  - mostly inspired by Python, each clause each consturction of language needs to be simplified to allow you write less code
   e,g, you dont need to write conrtucaion like: `get {{baseur}}/api/user` etc. you can define the base path at the top of file and use simple form `get /user`
- **Flexibility**: I am not a fun to run one request at a time, I prefer to run a bunch of them in one file, so I can write a query to get a token, then use it in the next query, maybe even different api etc. THat's what HTTL is about.
- **Modularity**: It would be perfect to have a way to reuse the code, so you can define a query in one file and use it in another one.
- **OpenApi Integration**: oh this is a favorite one - Yes it's about type checking and intellysense, long dream that came tru. finally :)
- **Extensibility**: The language should be abel to easy to extend, so you can write your own plugins, or use the existing ones.

All of this lead me to an idea to create this language, for developers 

I've stoped using Postamnt since beggingin of 2025 (checkout my video how to replace Postman with HTTL **put_link_link**) 

There is no better tool then a code that runs another code
