# The Basics
 
### Enough talk — show me the code!
 
```httl copy
    # Define a base URL for all requests
    @base: https://reqres.in/api

    # Getting a bearer token
    post /login {
      # You are free to use both JSON and JS styles for key-value pairs
      email: "eve.holt@reqres.in",
      "password": "cityslicka",
    }
    as auth # Store the JSON response body in the `auth` variable

    # Set a global Authorization header wich will be used in all requests below.
    # Also we can use dot notation to access the properties of the response body. 
    Authorization: Bearer {auth.token}

    # Create a new user
    post /users {
      name: "rob",
      job: "engineer",
    }
    as new_user # Store the response in the `new_user` variable 

    # Update the user
    put /users/{new_user.id} {
      name: "Robert",
      job: "CEO",
    }

    # Delete the user
    delete /users/{new_user.id}
    # Each request can have an assertion block to validate the status, headers, and body of the response 
    assert {
      status: 204,
      headers: {
        "Content-Length": "0",
      }
    }
    ```

I hope the code is self-explanatory. We’ll cover each section in detail on the following pages.
