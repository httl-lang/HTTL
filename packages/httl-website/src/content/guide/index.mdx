# The Basics
 
### Enough words, show me the code!
 
```httl filename="advanced.httl"
    # Comprehensive Example of all HTTL features
    @base: https://reqres.in/api

    # Getting a bearer token
    post /login {
      "email": "eve.holt@reqres.in",
      "password": "cityslicka",
    }
    as auth # Save the json response body to the variable auth

    # Set a global Authorization header wich will be used in all requests below.
    # Also we can use dot notation to access the properties of the response body. 
    Authorization: Bearer {auth.token}

    # Create a new user
    post /users {
      "name": "rob",
      "job": "engineer",
    }
    as new_user # save the response to the variable new_user

    # Update the user
    put /users/{new_user.id} {
      "name": "Robert",
      "job": "CEO", # not bad for a new user
    }

    # Delete the user (too much for a new user)
    delete /users/{new_user.id}
    # Each request can have an assertion block to validate the status, headers, and body of the response 
    assert {
      status: 204,
      headers: {
        "Content-Length": "0",
      }
    }
    ```
