# Use

As any other programming language, HTTL has a module system. 
You can import modules and use their functions in your queries.

let's say you have a module called `auth.httl` with the following content:

```httl filename="auth.httl"
@spec: https://httl.dev/api/spec.json
@auth-basic: admin admin

post /auth 
 as auth

Authorization: Bearer {auth.token}

```

now you can import this module in your query like this:

```httl filename="user-creation-test.httl" {1}
use './auth.httl'

put /users/1 {
	username: "jdoe_admin",
  email: "jdoe_admin@example.com",
  firstName: "John Admin",
  lastName: "Doe Admin",
	admin: true
}

delete /users/1 

```

by using `use './auth.httl'` noth `put` and `delete` requests will have the `Authorization` header set to `Bearer {auth.token}` that was defined in the `auth.httl` module.
Also you will have intellisense for the requests 

### Module resolution

The module path is resolved relative to the current file. mostly like in Javascript. 
so let say we have this structure:

```plaintext
- src
  - modules
    - auth.httl
  - tests
    - user-creation-test.httl
```

and in the `user-creation-test.httl` file you want to import the `auth.httl` module you can do it like this:

```httl
use '../modules/auth.httl'
```
