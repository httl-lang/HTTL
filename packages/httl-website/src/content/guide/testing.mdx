# Testing
 
HTTL provides a simple way to test your API requests.

**Note:** This feature is still in development, and we will be adding more functionalities in the future.

All you need to do is add `assert` to the end of your request.


```httl
post https://reqres.in/api/login {
  "email": "eve.holt@reqres.in",
  "password": "cityslicka",
}
assert {
  status: 200,
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json; charset=utf-8",
  },
  body: {
    token: "QpwL5tke4Pnpja7X4",
  },
}
```

There are three main elements in the `assert` block:

- `status`
- `headers`
- `body`


> [!NOTE]
>
> So far, we support only strict equality for all elements. However, as we continue to grow, we will add more comparison options.
