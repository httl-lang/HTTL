# Testing
 
Httl provides a simple way to test your API requests. 
All you need to do it to add `assert`to the end of your request.


```httl
post https://reqres.in/api/login {
  "email": "eve.holt@reqres.in",
  "password": "cityslicka",
}
assert {
  status: 200,
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json; charset=utf-8",
  },
  body: {
    token: "QpwL5tke4Pnpja7X4",
  },
}
```

The `assert` block can check the response status, headers, and body.
NOTE - so far we support only Strict Equality for all elements. But as we grow, we will add more options.
