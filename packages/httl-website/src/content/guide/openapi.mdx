# OpenAPI
 
Yes, yes and yes, HTTL supports the OpenAPI specification.

> [!NOTE]
>
> HTTL supports Swagger 2.x and OpenAPI 3.x specifications.
>

To integrate an OpenAPI specification file, simply add the @spec directive with the URL pointing to your OpenAPI specification.

### Syntax

```httl
@spec: <url>
```

### Example

```httl
@spec: https://httl.dev/api/spec.json

get <type '/' or press CMD|Ctrl+Space to see the list of available paths>
```

### IntelliSense

HTTL can autocomplete the paths and methods from the OpenAPI specification file.

HTTL can automatically generate the request body based on the OpenAPI specification.

To utilize this feature:
- Press the spacebar after the URL.
- HTTL will generate the request body.
- Accept the generated body by pressing the Tab key.

You can also use `CMD|Ctrl+Space` to see the list of available body schema.

> [!TIP]
>
> This feature is particularly useful when the IDE's IntelliSense conflicts with other plugins, especially Copilot's autogeneration.
