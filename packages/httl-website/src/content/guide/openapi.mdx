# OpenAPI
 
YEs yes and yes, we support OpenAPI specification.

All you need to do is to add `@spec` directive to your openApi json file.

```httl
@spec https://api.example.com/openapi.json

get <type Ctrl+Space to see the list of available paths>
```

So far there is support for Swagger 2.x and OpenAPI 3.x

the runtime can autocomplete the paths and autogeenrate body

* show example of autocompletion 
* and inlining body

add note that there is some caveats
