# URL

HTTL supports both full URLs and their shorter form.


## Full URL

Nothing to add. The full URL is a full URL.

```httl
get https://httl.dev/api/users
```


## Shorter Form  

### HTTL allows you to omit the protocol when specifying a URL. By default:

- **For non-local URLs**, HTTL automatically uses the `https` protocol.  

  ```httl
  get httl.dev/api/users  # Equivalent to: get https://httl.dev/api/users
  ```  

- **For local URLs**, HTTL defaults to the `http` protocol.  

  ```httl
  get localhost/api/users  # Equivalent to: get http://localhost/api/users
  ```  

### Special Form for Localhost  

For convenience, `localhost` can be omitted in HTTL.  

- **Using just a port**:  

  ```httl
  get :3000/api/users  # Equivalent to: get http://localhost:3000/api/users
  ```  

- **Without a port** (defaults to `http://localhost`):  

  ```httl
  get :/api/users  # Equivalent to: get http://localhost/api/users
  ```
