# Module System

Like any other programming language, HTTL has a module system.
You can import modules and utilize their context within your files.

There are two main components in the module system:
- [API Object](#api-object)
- [Use statement](#use)

## Api Object

HTTL introduces the concept of the `API` object â€” a virtual entity that acts as a centralized container for global headers, directives, and variables defined within a file.

> [!NOTE]
>
> A default API object is automatically created when a file begins processing.
>

All global-level headers, directives, and variable declarations are inherently associated with this default API object, serving as the foundational configuration context for subsequent requests.

For example, if you specify a global header in a file, it is automatically linked to the default API object and will be applied to all requests within that file.

**Example:**

```httl
# Authorization header is applied to the all requests below
Authorization: Bearer token

get /users

post /users {
  name: "morpheus",
  job: "leader"
}

delete /users/1
```

Also, any api elements can be overridden within the file by redefining them.

```httl {6}
@base: https://httl.dev/api

get /users # https://httl.dev/api/users

# @base is overridden
@base: https://httl.dev/api/v2

get /users # https://httl.dev/api/v2/users
```

## Use

Now, let's move from the virtual to the real.  
You can import another module using the `use` keyword.

Suppose you have a module named `auth.httl` with the following content:

```httl filename="auth.httl"
@spec: https://httl.dev/api/spec.json
@auth-basic: admin admin

post /auth 
 as auth

Authorization: Bearer {auth.token}

```

Now you can import this module in your file like this:

```httl filename="user-creation-test.httl" {1}
use './auth.httl'

put /users/1 {
	username: "jdoe_admin",
  email: "jdoe_admin@example.com",
  firstName: "John Admin",
  lastName: "Doe Admin",
	admin: true
}

delete /users/1 
```

**Note:** Both `PUT` and `DELETE` requests require the `Authorization` header.

Because we import the `auth.httl` file, the API object from that file is merged with the current API object, and `Authorization: Bearer {auth.token}` becomes part of your global headers.  
It's as if you copy-pasted the content of the `auth.httl` file into the `user-creation-test.httl` file.

> [!TIP]
>
> It's good practice to keep your authorization and other preparatory requests in a separate file, keeping your main module clean and easy to read.

### Module resolution

The module path is resolved relative to the current file, much like in JavaScript.  
So, let's say we have the following structure:
 
<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name="src" defaultOpen>
    <FileTree.Folder name="modules" defaultOpen>
      <FileTree.File name="auth.httl" />
    </FileTree.Folder>
    <FileTree.Folder name="tests" defaultOpen>
      <FileTree.File name="user-creation-test.httl" />
    </FileTree.Folder>
  </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>


To import the `auth.httl` module in the `user-creation-test.httl` file, you can do it like this:

```httl
use '../modules/auth.httl'
```

## Default .httl file

Remember that the main idea of the language is simplicity and readability.
That's why we have a feature called the default `.httl` file.

This file will be imported into every file by default.

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name="src" defaultOpen>
    <FileTree.Folder name="modules" defaultOpen>
      <FileTree.File name="auth.httl" />
    </FileTree.Folder>
    <FileTree.Folder name="tests" defaultOpen>
      <FileTree.File name="user-creation-test.httl" />
    </FileTree.Folder>
    <FileTree.File name=".httl" active />
  </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>

It's a great place to put your global headers, directives, and variables that you want to apply to all your files.

```httl filename=".httl"
@spec: https://httl.dev/api/spec.json
@auth-basic: admin admin

post /auth 
 as auth

Authorization: Bearer {auth.token}
```

Now, every file will have the `@spec` and `Authorization: Bearer {auth.token}` by default.

```httl filename="user-creation-test.httl"
put /users/1 {
  username: "jdoe_admin",
  firstName: "John Admin",
  lastName: "Doe Admin",
  admin: true
}

delete /users/1
```
