# Variables

You can store the response of a query in a variable and use it in subsequent queries. 
This is useful when you want to use the same response in multiple places.

```httl
@base: https://reqres.in/api

post /login {
  "email": "eve.holt@reqres.in",
  "password": "cityslicka",
}
as auth 

Authorization: Bearer {auth.token}

post /users {
  "name": "rob",
  "job": "engineer",
}

```

variable can also be via autocomplete
the response body is parsed and the properties are available for autocompletion


note about response headers

to mention - string interpolation
