# Variables

It's hard to imagine a programming language without being able to use variables. \
In HTTL, you can store the response of a query in a variable and use it in subsequent queries. 

### Example

```httl /auth/
post /login {
  email: "email",
  password: "password",
}
as auth 

Authorization: Bearer {auth.token}

post /users {
  name: "rob",
  job: "engineer",
}
```

> [!NOTE]
>
> HTTL stores the response body in a variable instead of the entire response object.
> This design choice keeps the language simple and easy to use.
> Future releases will include more advanced features for working with the response object.

### Usage

You can use variables in the following places:
- Headers:
  ```httl /auth.token/
  Authorization: Bearer {auth.token}
  ```

- Query parameters:
  ```httl /auth.token/
  get /users?token={auth.token}
  # or
  get /{auth.url}?token={auth.token}
  ```

- Request body: 
  ```httl /auth.token/
  
  post /users { 
    name: "rob",
    token: auth.token, # you don't need to use curly braces here
    audit: "Token used {auth.token}" # string interpolation is supported
  }

  ```
