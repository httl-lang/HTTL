# Directives
 
Let's say we have a simple script like this:

 
```httl

get https://api.example.com/data
post https://api.example.com/data

```

but we don't want to repeat the URL `https://api.example.com` in every request. 
Sure we can use a globlal header `Host: api.example.com` but it's only about the host, not the full URL.

that why we need something that extends HTTP specification.

like a directive, a way to encapsulate common parts of the request.

 
```httl

@base https://api.example.com

get /data
post /data

```

There are several directives in httl:
- `@base` - sets the base URL for the current api
- `@spec` - sets the OpenAPI specification for current api
- `@auth-basic` - sets the Authentification header for current api
