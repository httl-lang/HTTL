# Api Object

HTTL introduces API object â€“ virtual entity which acts as centralized container for global headers, directives, and variables defined within a file. 
A default API object is automatically created when a file begins processing. 
All global-level headers, directives, and variable declarations are inherently associated with this default API object, serving as the foundational configuration context for the next requests.

For example, if we specify a global header in a file, it is automatically associated with the default API object and will be applied to all requests within the file.

```httl
Authorization: Bearer token

# Authorization header is applied to all requests below
get /users

post /users {
  name: "morpheus",
  job: "leader"
}

delete /users/1
```

Api elements can be overridden within the file.

```httl
@base: https://httl.dev/api

get /users # https://httl.dev/api/users

@base: https://httl.dev/api/v2

get /users # https://httl.dev/api/v2/users
```

When you import a file, the API object of the imported file is merged with the current API object.
