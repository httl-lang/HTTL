# HTTL - HyperText Transfer Language

HTTL (HyperText Transfer Language) is a lightweight programming language designed for developers who prefer using code to interact with APIs rather than relying on a UI. It is a declarative language that allows you to write HTTP queries, store their results in variables, and reference them in subsequent queries—similar to SQL.

HTTL simplifies data exchange and orchestration across diverse services by allowing you to write queries for multiple APIs in a single file.

# IDE Integration

- **Declarative Syntax**: Write API queries similar to SQL.
